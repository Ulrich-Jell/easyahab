This programm aims to simplyfy the voting and counting processes in the hessian Kommunahlwahl.

Instead of handing out huge papers, that could be used as wallpaper, voters make thier choices on a computer and print out thier individual, yet anonymos ballot.
This saves ressources, as the ballots do not need to be printed beforehand. Also there are no unused ballots that would have thrown away.

Also the counting process is much easier, since the election assistants only have to deal with Din A4 sheets of paper with only the exact information they need to count the votes.

Update November 15:
The Programm has now a functional GUI

To do:
- database connection
- export ballot as a pdf-file
